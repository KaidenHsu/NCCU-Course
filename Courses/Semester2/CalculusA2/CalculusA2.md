## Course Description
Calculus is a basic, university-entrance-level mathematics course that is needed as a prerequisite for the majority of the other university-level mathematics courses. The main goal of the course is to expose students to the fundamentals of calculus as well as provide rigorous training in analytic thinking and (mathematical) problem-solving.
