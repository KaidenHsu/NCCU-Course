## Course Description
This course aims to introduce data science from a pragmatic, practice-oriented viewpoint. Students will learn concepts, R programming language, and tools they need to deal with various facets of data science practice, including data integration, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, evaluation, and effective visual communication. By the end of the course, they will be able to apply data science techniques to their research topics.
