## Course Description
Taking a video and posting it on social media, sending video messages to friends, watching videos on Youtube, etc., have almost already become our daily lives. Without video compression, these would never become possible. This course offers students a fundamental understanding of video compression, covering the video coding flow and techniques, including the most commonly used video coding standards, H.264 and H.265. Also, we will also introduce some video compression or processing techniques based on deep learning.
