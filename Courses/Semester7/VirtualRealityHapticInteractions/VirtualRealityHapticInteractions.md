## Course Details
- Type of Credit: Elective
- Credits: 3
- Course Department: Computer Science/B/3&4
- Instructor: Prof. 蔡欣叡
- Prerequisites: N/A
- Session: wed14-17

## Course Description
This course teaches the students not only how to use and program with VR devices but also how to combine VR devices and other sensor or feedback devices, such as motors, to achieve VR haptic interactions. The course covers prototyping techniques, paper reading, research discussion and project implementation in VR haptic interactions in human-computer interaction (HCI). The topics include Unity, VR, Arduino programming, motors, 3D printing and research discussion.

Students must attend the first class.

DCT undergraduate students are welcome to take this course but basic programming ability is required.
